\section{Methods}
Methodology: carefully describe the methods you use and why they are appropriate for answering your search questions. It must include
\subsection{Casual Inference}
a brief overview of causal inference, which should be written in a way such that another student in Data 100 who has never been exposed to the concept can carry out the analyses involving the datasets in your project.
\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsection{Modeling}
