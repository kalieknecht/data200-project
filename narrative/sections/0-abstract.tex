\section{Abstract}
In this work we attempt to build a model to determine temperature of a region based on greenhouse gas emissions. We use data provided by the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting System to explore the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature for areas in the United States.
