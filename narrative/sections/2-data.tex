\section{Data}
The data used in this project is Dataset 2A: Climate and the Environment - General Measurements and Statistics. This dataset contains some general statistics and measurements of various aspects of the climate and the environment. It includes the following reports:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{daily\_global\_weather}: Daily global weather from GHCN from January to October 2020
    \item \textit{greenhouse\_gas\_type} and \textit{greenhouse\_gas\_facility}: greenhouse gas emissions data reported by EPA, detailing the specific types of gas reported by facilities and general information about the facilities themselves. The dataset is made available through EPA’s GHGRP (Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program).
    \item \textit{us\_air\_quality}: air quality on a county level from approximately 4000 monitoring stations around the United States, reported from EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS)
\end{itemize}

I am also using data generated by my research group, Radwatch, from our DoseNet monitoring stations. The DoseNet stations each include a basic nuclear radiation counter which provides the dose-rate shown on our default map. Several locations now also include outside stations with an advanced gamma radiation spectrometer, a carbon dioxide monitor and particulate matter air quality sensor, and a pressure, temperature, humidity gauge.Our network begins in UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL), and stretches out to secondary schools across the Bay Area. This network also includes a growing number of satellite networks through our international partners.

Our basic dosimeters count radiation interactions that deposit energy in the device, giving the counts per minute (CPM) averaged over a 5-minute interval. The CPM is converted to a rate of radiation dose that people are being exposed to. Each dosimeter then takes this measurement and sends it to a central server, where it is displayed on RadWatch. This system allows for real-time monitoring of radiation levels.

Our monitoring stations are generally installed in local Bay Area high schools and various places around the world where we have research connections.
