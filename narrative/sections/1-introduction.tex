\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Research Question}
I'll be exploring countries which emit the most greenhouse gases vs which areas of the world are more affected by global warming. Can we build a model to determine temperature based on greenhouse gas emissions? Additionally I will take a look at how the nuclear energy capacity of each country correlates to their greenhouse gas output. I would also like to explore some radiation data in relation to this second question, which I will obtain from my research group's environmental monitoring stations. 

I will be investigating this using the data provided by the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), which contains the average daily temperature recorded at monitoring stations around the world. I will also be using the data provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through their Greenhouse Gas Reporting System.
