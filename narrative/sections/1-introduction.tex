\section{Introduction}
I'll be exploring countries which emit the most greenhouse gases vs which areas of the world are more affected by global warming. Additionally I will take a look at how the nuclear energy capacity of each country correlates to their greenhouse gas output. I would also like to explore some radiation data in relation to this second question, which I will obtain from my research group's environmental monitoring stations.

Clearly stated research questions and why they are interesting and important. You must include at least one research question involving at least one or more datasets from one of the topics we provided, but you may include additional research questions about each individual dataset. At least one of your research questions has to include a modeling component, e.g., can we build a model using climate data to predict growth in COVID-19 cases accurately?

A brief survey of related work on the topic(s) of your analysis and how your project differs from or complements existing research.
